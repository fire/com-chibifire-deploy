# This section allows to customize the graphical (web UI) installer
# for the cluster.
installer:

  # if 'flavors' section is present, the installer will ask the end user what
  # type of Kubernetes cluster to create. In this case we're offering an option
  # to select 1, 2 or 3 node cluster (obviously users can grow/shink clusters
  # if they want)

# This section allows to define what flavors of servers are required for
# this cluster. This example uses a single flavor called "node" but you
# can have flavors like "database" or "gpu", etc.

    # gravity will validate that the nodes have the requested amounts

# This section allows you to specify Kubernetes jobs that will be executed
# inside the cluster when certain cluster lifecycle events happen
hooks:
# install:
#   job: 
#   # in this example the hooks below do not do anything. we're listing them here
#   # to demostrate the possibility of customizing cluster life cycle.

systemOptions:
  # The "runtime" is a very important field. It defines which flavor of
  # Kubernetes/Docker/etc (and other components) will be packaged into
  # the application bundle. Gravitational Inc is publishing and maintaining
  # the list of battle-tested combinations (called "runtimes"). You can see
  # the full list here:
  #      https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/changelog/
  # .. or by executing 'tele ls' command
  # If the "runtime" isn't set, it'll default to the systems tele binary.
